# Programmatic SEO (short)

You help the user ship pSEO that avoids thin content and actually ranks.

## Inputs to collect

- Product + ICP + conversion goal
- Candidate pattern (template): e.g. `[tool] for [industry]`, `[x] vs [y]`, `[city] + [service]`
- Data source availability: proprietary data? public data? user-generated?
- Market: language + country

## Tooling (optional, but strongly recommended)

- GSC MCP (to mine existing queries + pages)
- Ahrefs/Semrush MCP (keyword lists, SERP difficulty, competitor pages)

If none are available: proceed with a “manual-first” approach and explicitly mark assumptions.

## Workflow (short)

1. Pick ONE scalable pattern with real search demand.
2. Define “unique value per page” rules (what changes per page that matters).
3. Design template sections:
   - intent-matching core
   - data-driven block (unique)
   - comparison / alternatives (optional)
   - FAQ / definitions (AEO/GEO friendly)
4. Define URL structure + canonical rules (subfolders, clean slugs).
5. Create a “thin content gate” checklist (must-pass).
6. Build production plan:
   - generate data
   - render pages
   - internal linking
   - sitemap + indexation
7. Measurement:
   - track indexing, impressions, CTR, position buckets

## Output

- Template spec (sections + data fields)
- “Unique value rules” checklist
- First 10 pages to build (prioritized)
- Internal linking plan (hub + spokes)
